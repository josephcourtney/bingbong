- Add a --dry-run flag that applies to every subcommand. It should act exactly like normal but should make no changes to files or settings. After the normal stdout and stderr output, it should list out every action that would have been taken.
- Add a `configure` subcommand
  - Prompt for chime schedule, suppression windows, timezone, and custom sounds.
  - Print out the updated settings, indicating changes, and ask for confirmation before writing to file.
  - Store settings in the current config file if it exists, or in the default location otherwise.
- Enhance status reporting.
  - Show:
    - next scheduled chime time
    - active suppression source (manual vs. DND)
    - current configuration path
  - Use clear labels like “Next chime: 14:00 (in 45 min)”.
- Make feedback and error messaging consistent
  - Always prefix messages with context (“OK:”, “WARN:”, “ERROR:”).
  - Handle missing dependencies uniformly at startup.
  - Surface rebuild results explicitly.
- Unify pause interface. Merge `pause` and `unpause` into a single `silence [--until YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM | --minutes N]` command with auto‑toggle.
- Enhance log management. 
  - `logs --follow`
  - `logs --lines N`
  - rotate logs automatically when exceeding `LOG_ROTATE_SIZE`
  - display rotated files in `status` and `doctor`
- use `rich` for color and formatting
  - success: green
  - warning: yellow
  - errors: red
  - align output widths and use monospace tables for summaries
  - offer a `--no‑color` switch for environments that don’t support ANSI styling.
- Add documentation and examples.
  - Include a “Quickstart” section in README with common workflows and sample cron snippets.
  - Provide default config templates and explain XDG_DATA_HOME vs. macOS defaults.
- Implement shell‐completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell.
- Add a `version` command or `--version` flag to report the current release.
- Allow users to customize log file paths and configure verbosity levels in the config file.
- Extend the test suite to cover the new commands, and options
- Add runtime telemetry (opt‑in) for error reporting and usage statistics.
- Document audio‑backend requirements and config file schema in the README.
